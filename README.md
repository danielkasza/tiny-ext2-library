# Tiny read-only Ext2 filesystem library

This is a tiny implementation of the Ext2 filesystem that should be suitable for resource constrained systems.
Functions are provided for reading files.
Listing directories is not yet supported, but that functionality could be added easily.
Internally, the library is already able to look at directories.
